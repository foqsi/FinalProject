            <h2>About Viet Nam</h2>
            <img src="images/vietnam-geo.png" alt="Vietnam Geography Map" width="1024px">
            <p>Vietnam is a country located in Southeast Asia. It is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the
                northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to the east and south. The total land area
                of Vietnam is approximately 331,212 square kilometers. The capital city of Vietnam is Hanoi, while the
                largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.

                Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces and 5 municipalities, including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong,
                Can Tho, and Da Nang. The country is known for its stunning landscapes, including mountains, beaches,
                and rice terraces. The Mekong Delta, located in the southern part of Vietnam, is a fertile region known
                for its rice production.

                Vietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party government led by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The
                country has a president and a prime minister as its highest-ranking officials. Vietnam is divided into
                three regions: the north, the central, and the south. The economy of Vietnam has grown rapidly in recent
                years, with a focus on exports and manufacturing. The country has a population of over 97 million
                people, making it the 15th most populous country in the world. Vietnamese is the official language, and
                the majority of the population practices Buddhism.</p>
